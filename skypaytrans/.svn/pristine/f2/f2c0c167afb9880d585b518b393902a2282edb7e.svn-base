			you, with access to your personal information and shall further
			ensure that any personal information or sensitive personal data or
			information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or

			information or sensitive personal data or information to be retained
			by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users
			to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
			corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may
			decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
			systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the
			privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance,
			requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for
			which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide
			information access and correction, we perform this service free of
			charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

			your information, residual copies may take a period of time before
			they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup
			systems.

			to get their data back in case their phone’s data becomes unusable,
			or phone gets lost, or the user moves to a new phone device. We also
			use this backup to provide useful insights and information related to
			their spends such as weekly spends in a month, insights related to
			spend behaviour, etc., and to provide information related to user
			spends, patterns and user data in the form of aggregated and
			anonymized statistics on data such as user spends by category, date,
			time, bank balances, etc.

			make will be effective immediately on notice, which we may give by
			posting the new policy on the Site. Your use of the ezkhata App
			Services after such notice will be deemed acceptance of such changes.
