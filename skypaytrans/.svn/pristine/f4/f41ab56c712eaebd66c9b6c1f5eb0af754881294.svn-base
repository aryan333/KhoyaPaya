   </div>
 </div>
 
 
 
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-12">
   <h3>How do I keep my account secure?</h3>
   <p class="text-justify">Never share your login credentials.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Beware of websites & social media pages that propagate fake offers.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Change your password regularly.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Never entertain calls asking for EZKHATA credentials or credit/debit card details.</p>
   </div>
 </div>
 
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-12">
   <h3>What should I know about email fraud?</h3>
   <p class="text-justify">Be aware of any email message that requests personal data—such as passwords, or sends you to a web site that asks for such information. This practice is referred as Phishing, which is fraudulent communication designed to deceive consumers into divulging personal, financial or account information.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">These websites or emails may involve the illegal practice of “spoofing,” or forging a website or email address to resemble another, legitimate address and business. Remember to never enter your credentials over such websites or send personal information via an email. If you come across such websites or receive such emails, please contact EZKHATA immediately.</p>
   </div>
 </div>
 
 <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-12">
   <h3>What should I know about phone fraud?</h3>
   <p class="text-justify">It’s important for consumers to know that EZKHATA will not call customers to request their personal account information or any credit card, debit card or net banking details. </p>
    <p class="text-justify">Consumers should not respond to any phone calls with requests for any such information and are advised to immediately report the situation to local law enforcement as well as the concerned financial institution.</p>

 </div>
 
 
 <!<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-12">
   <h3>How can I check if the website is fraud or not?</h3>
   <p class="text-justify">A web-address which looks OK might not be a legitimate site. Following measures may help you identify if the URL is legitimate.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Incorrect or incomplete company name: e.g. spelling error like www.EZKHATAI.com or www.SACA.com is not same as www.EZKHATA.com.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Before entering any information, make sure your browser is showing the padlock symbol next to the address bar and that the address starts with https://. Without these signs, there’s no guarantee of security or encryption of your details.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Cheap-looking sites – Fake sites masquerading as big brands don’t necessarily have the time and investment dedicated to them as the real thing.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Do your research – If you haven’t used a website before, check its credentials. Search for alternative contact details such as address or phone number – if in doubt, call them first..</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Trust your instincts – If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you ever feel a site isn’t legitimate, don’t enter any personal information, and leave immediately.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Be wary – If a site you regularly visit seems different, double check that it’s the real site.</p>
   <p class="text-justify">Update your software – Your internet browser includes security functions which can help spot sites masquerading as trusted sites, and can even tell you before you arrive that the site is a fake. Check that the security options are enabled in your browser.</p>
